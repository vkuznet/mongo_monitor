This is very simple tool with aim to help developers/admins to monitor MongoDB activity
via web interface. Insipred by awstat, mongostat, protovis tools. It is written in
Python and depends on python, pymongo driver, CherryPy (python web framework) and
protovis (http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/) JS graphics library.

INSTALLATION:
------------

Download mongo_monitor.py python script, make it executable, e.g. chmod +x mongo_monitor.py
Download protovis library and place it into the same directory as mongo_monitor.py
Install CherryPy on your system.

USAGE:
-----
very simple, just run ./mongo_monitor.py
You can provide optional --uri parameter to specify the location of your MongoDB. For
more options see ./mongo_monitor.py --help

Please note, the tool will create mongodb.stats collection in your MongoDB and
will store periodically the stat info over there. This info is generated via
db.command( { "serverStatus" : 1 } ) with given interval. Finally, once enough statistics
will be accumulated, you'll be able to see nice plots done by protovis library.
